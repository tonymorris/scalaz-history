Scalaz: the history, the motivation, the battles, the future

It was early 2008, working for a small Java consultancy company in Brisbane that
Scalaz came to be.

In this talk, we will have some fun looking at the Scalaz library when it first
started and the objectives that necessitated it. Some of the more ubiquitous
abstractions of Scalaz will be discussed in detail, along with examples of
practical application.

Scalaz has had a contentious history, with staunch absence of compromise for
less principled approaches to programming. We will look at the reasons for this
approach and the practical outcomes that result. The talk also address some of
the most common concerns surrounding the Scalaz library.
